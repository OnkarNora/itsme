                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Ok so let's start with my childhood , as like every other child in early days of my school, 
                            i cried a lot but i think in my school days i was not like hating studies and all, its just that  
                            i am a little confused that, why i am doing all this crazy things but as i grew up and i found this 
                            things ("studies") are very important in any one's life .<br/>
                            So when i was in my 4th grade, i remember that i was smart kid ( "at least i think in that way" )
                            at that time, i always used to do things like playing games, we had a computer at home i always tried downloading games 
                            , but it was actually difficult to play those games at that time , but still i liked how computers were working, 
                            i was always curiuos that what's going on inside a computer.<br/>
                            at this stage of my life all things were going right, i mean i was good at studies , there were no problems in my 
                            personal life but the actual story begins when i entered 7th grade , there were lot of things happened in my life,
                            mainly i got new friends and i came to know that what actually life means, what you need to do, to survive in this crazy world,
                            so now i actually decided what i am going to be in my life ,i dicided to become a <b>Computer Engineer.</b><br/>
                            at this point i faced challenges, competitions . In my class there was a good friend of mine who was so intelligent and smart
                            everyone was jeoulus to him. i am not going to take his name but he was different , it looked like he was much ahead of all of us.

                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4 text-center">The Story Of 10th Grade</h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            So when i was in 9th i became social, i mean i created facebook, whatsapp, twitter and every other social media app 
                            that you could possibaly think of and you know what i was actually addicted to them so much that i ignored my studies,
                            i always used share creepy, funky jokes and every picture that i was taking at that time, but time teaches you lessons 
                            and i finally stoped all those things, but i would say becoming social taught me so many things. <br/>
                            Ok after all these socilalism i again strated focusing on my studies. i joined classes with this friend of mine that you know 
                            from previous story. we decided to be the best at studies we used to make so many books for different purposes like 
                            one book for all formulas , one book for all theorems, one book for all definations, etc. but never completed them. <br/>
                            let me a good story so in our school there, was tradition followed that 9th grade students should arrange any kind of 
                            competition for 8th grade students , when we were at 8th grade 9th grade students arranged a Quiz competition for us
                            we liked that competition so much that we decided that we also gonna do a Quiz competion so we satrted working on it.
                            and there were so many ideas coming from all students. all students wanted to host that quiz competition but finnaly i 
                            got that chance, there i learnt what it feels when you are at the Stage and what stage daring is. <br/>
                            So a big thing happened in my life the first time when i was about to get suspended from school.
                            when i was in 10th grade i used to sit on last benches with all the talky nature friends. in 10th a new girl came to our school
                            she don't know much about us. so she complained our class teacher that we always make noise on back bench. i don't know why 
                            but sir took it seriously and he called all of four students including me in vice prinicipal's cabin. but let me tell you that
                            vice prinicipal's favorite student was me because i always used take part in speeches and all so vice principal was like 
                            good friend to me. but when we reached his cabin he was not there our class teacher said that you all need to write a letter 
                            that "if i do such things again, school can suspende me" all other three wrote it, there were tears in all of our eyes ,now 
                            it's time for me to write that letter but guess what who enters "The vice principal" and he took pen from my hands and said don't worry
                            just go attend your lecture. all of us was so sad that no one wanted to attend the lecture we asked teacher to enter class everyone 
                            hitted the door so badly and went to our places our heads were down and everyone was crying and thinking what went wrong is talking 
                            that much bad thing that we were about to get suspended from school. also in all these senario our class teacher replaced my place 
                            to front bench with the so called good friend of mine that you know from earlier article. which actually changed my life. read the first 
                            day of my college to know how.

                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4 text-center">The Days Of College</h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            So after all of those 10th creepy things i finally got into college,so in our city the one collage was so famous 
                            and everyone wanted to get into that college but you need to have good grades for it. To be fair i got 83.40% in 10th. 
                            so all my other friends were going for a different college because they got less marks so i also decided to go to 
                            that same college but anyhow i ended up in that famous college that i was talking about. so now from our school 
                            particularly from my class more specifically from boys only me and that so called good friend of mine was in 
                            the college. here our friendship and understanding became more strong. we always used to stay together in college.
                            in every person's mind we both created a different picture of us. <br/>
                            so as we are in college we started thinking that what should we take like Biology or mathmatics. he said we definatly should 
                            go for biology but somewhere in my mind i know that i like computers and i wanted to make my carrear in that field 
                            but he was successfully convenced me to go for M.B.B.S. but we didn't changed our subject we took both bio and math 
                            our primary focus was going for NEET (a entrance exam for MBBS) but to be honest i never enjoyed learning bio. i mean it 
                            is a good subject but i was not so much into it. <br/>
                            so when i was learning 11th i was so free , i mean i never took subjects seriously. but in 12th we joined classes of 
                            a unknown teachers they were from a college that actually more famous than our college you need to have atleast 90% to 
                            get into that college.  they were teaching only five of us in a small room that they hired. speaking about studies 
                            as i said i was not taking them seriously but i understood it later that how much big thing this NEET and JEE was.<br/>
                            time passed finally the day arrived when we need to give exam for JEE, i remember the date was 9 Jan because at that date
                            our prime minister arrived at our city. i was just guessing the answers of quetions. and result came out only after 10 days 
                            from exam, and my marks were so disappoing for me. i can't even tell you them. this was the first JEE we also got another chance 
                            the result of that JEE was also same, i realized my mistake and i started preparing for a CET meanwhile we gave NEET also but 
                            i will not say much about it, so now in CET i got so good marks that i even didn't expected, 95% which i think just miracal 
                            of God because i definately not deserve those marks. anyway to get in the Computer engineering you need 93% for a good college.
                            i finally got admission in good college. Read more in my next artical to know further story.

                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Ok, so now i was actually Alone, you already know that only me and my one friend was in juniour college but now we 
                            both separated he took Pharmacy and i took computer engineering. it's not like i was completely alone because there were 
                            some friends of mine took enginnering but specifically no one took computer enginnering. after lot of efforts finally the 
                            first day of college started. as i said there was no one with me so that we could attend lecture together. as it is the first 
                            day i was so nurvous and lonely. but i convenced my self that you need to anyhow sort all things out because this is going to 
                            be for next four years. i decided that i need to be the best because there is competition in every place. i choosed this field 
                            even if i fail it's my decision. i started thinking that if this is my only one life i need to make it better because 
                            i am not going get any another chance. <br/>
                            As time passed i also got introduced to new friends i think everyone here is a intelligent person. to survive 
                            here you need to be the best. there was quote by Oscar Wilde :<b>"Be yourself; Everyone else is already taken."</b><br/>
                            Now i am finnaly a good, perfect and sincere person who knows how to live a good life . i am happy with my life that i am living now 
                            but i still miss my old days.........To be continued.<br/>
